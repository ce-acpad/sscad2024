          short_bio: "Felix Wolf is a full professor at the Department of Computer Science of the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany, where he leads the Laboratory for Parallel Programming. He works on methods, tools, and algorithms that support developing and deploying parallel software systems in various life-cycle stages. Wolf received his Ph.D. degree from RWTH Aachen University in 2003. After working more than two years as a postdoc at the Innovative Computing Laboratory of the University of Tennessee, he was appointed research group leader at Juelich Supercomputing Centre. Between 2009 and 2015, he was head of the Laboratory for Parallel Programming at the German Research School for Simulation Sciences in Aachen and a full professor at RWTH Aachen University. Wolf has made major contributions to several open-source performance tools for parallel programs, including Scalasca, Score-P, and Extra-P. Moreover, he has initiated the Virtual Institute – High Productivity Supercomputing, an international initiative of HPC programming-tool builders aimed at enhancing, integrating, and deploying their products. He has published over 150 refereed articles on parallel computing, several of which have received awards."
          abstract: "To understand the scaling behavior of HPC applications, developers often use performance models. A performance model is a formula that expresses a critical performance metric, such as runtime, as a function of one or more execution parameters, such as core count and input size. Performance models offer quick insights on a very high level of abstraction, including predictions of future behavior. Given the complexity of today’s applications, which often combine several sophisticated algorithms, creating performance models manually is extremely laborious. Empirical performance modeling, the process of learning such models from performance data, offers a convenient alternative but comes with its own set of challenges.  The two most prominent ones are noise and the cost of the experiments needed to generate the underlying data. In this talk, we will review the state of the art in empirical performance modeling and investigate how we can employ machine learning and other strategies to improve the quality and lower the cost of the resulting models."
